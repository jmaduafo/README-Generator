# Professional Readme Generator

            ## Description
            
            I wanted to create a system to efficiently and quickly construct my very own readme with less headache. I learned that using this method to create files can save a lot of time.

            ## Installation

            You must have inquirer installed as a package first and foremost, installed as "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the integrated terminal in the index.js file and then you can enter "node index.js" or "node index" in the terminal and press enter.
            
            ## Usage
            
            The application asks the user a series of questions that they can either choose to answer depending on what the user needs for the readme file. Though some questionsa are required such as title and github.
